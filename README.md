scMamba:Towards learning on single-cell data with State Space Models

## Introduction
To address all the abovementioned limitations, we present scMamba , a new class of machine learning on
singel-cell data based on state space model. In summary we propose:
- Recipe for SSM model under single-cell scenerio
- An effective ordering scheme
- A pretraining scheme
-  A Foundation Model trained with large scale of data
